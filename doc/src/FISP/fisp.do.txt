===== Strategic importance =====
!bblock


_The aim is to lay the foundation for the development of new
activities in Computational Science and Physics at the University of Oslo, with a strong focus on
computational technologies for the future, from quantum computing to machine learning._   

o The proposed  activities are expected to lead to an application  for a future center of excellence (The Norwegian SFF program) in Computational Physics and Science application, _Computing Across the Disciplines_, where focus on new computational approaches for studying complex systems will play a central role. 

o Establish an educational Marie-Curie training program on Computational Science and Physics,

o Strong links with the newly established center of excellence in education, Center for Computing in Science Education

===== Multiscale Science =====

!bblock
The aim of our research  program on multiscale physics is to develop a first
principle approach to systems of relevance for a variety of fields,
from materials science to nano-technology and biological systems and
even atomic nuclei and stars.  

Common to all these systems is that
they entail a truly multiscale physics program that involves a proper
understanding of the links between the various scales, starting from
quantum-mechanical first principle studies of atoms, molecules and
eventually other spatially confined systems to Density functional
theories and finally microscopically derived potentials to be used in
molecular dynamics calculations. Such a program involves insights and collaborations across disciplines in order to foster progress.

===== Why Quantum Computing and Machine Learning =====

!bblock
_Quantum Computing and Machine Learning_ are two of the most promising
approaches for studying complex physical systems where several length
and energy scales are involved.

===== Challenges to Traditional Many-Particle Methods =====
!bblock
Traditional many-particle methods,
either quantum mechanical or classical ones, face huge dimensionality
problems when applied to studies of systems with many interacting
particles. 

To be able to define properly effective potentials for
realistic molecular dynamics simulations of billions or more particles,
requires both precise quantum mechanical studies as well as algorithms
that allow for parametrizations and simplifications of quantum
mechanical results. Quantum Computing offers now an interesting
avenue, together with traditional algorithms, for studying complex
quantum mechanical systems.

===== More Challenges to Traditional Many-Particle Methods =====
!bblock

Machine Learning allows us to parametrize
these results in terms of classical interactions. These interactions
are in turn suitable for large scale molecular dynamics simulations of
complicated systems spanning from subatomic physics to materials
science and life science.

_Machine Learning_ plays nowadays a central role in the analysis of large data sets in order to extract information about complicated correlations. This information is often difficult to obtain with traditional methods. 

o Developing activities in these frontier computational technologies is thus of strategic importance for  our capability to address future science problems.

o The problems we target satisfy the dual criteria of being integral to the fundamental understanding of complex physical systems  and also compelling a major conceptual advance in method or theory with broad applications to other science fields.

===== Background and previous experience =====
!bblock

* This research is strongly rooted in the activities of the award winning Computational Physics group at the Department of Physics. 

* We have presently several (6) excellent PhD candidates who are finalizing or have finalized their Master of Science theses. Many of these candidates  have applied and developed Machine Learning methods to solve complex and interacting many-particle systems. We have presently 27 MSc students.

* The two PIs have a long-standing experience in developing and applying algorithms for quantum mechanical and molecular dynamics simulations of many interacting particles, with applications spanning from dense subatomic matter to the physics of complex materials and life science. 

* The proposal will also benefit from extensive collaborations with leading Universities and Laboratories in Northern America (Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Michigan State University and  University of Washington).

===== Research Program =====
!bblock

The research program will focus on two main topics:
 * _Quantum Computing_ for studies of quantum mechanical systems with many particles (_PhD 1_). The focus is on
  * Subatomic matter, in particular properties of dense matter
  * Atomic and molecular physics, with applications to Materials Science and Life Science
 * _Machine Learning_ focusing on the training of potentials for Molecular dynamics studies of large numbers of interacting particles (_PhD 2_), with applications to systems in  
  * Condensed Matter Physics,
  * Materials Science and 
  * Life Science

A Machine Learning approach to Science Education, as represented by the CCSE, offers a link for further synergies and testbeds of algorithms from Machine Learning.
